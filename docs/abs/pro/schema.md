> [!NOTE]
> When making an API request using the ABS Procedures (PRO) schema, it is crucial to include the correct schema identifier. The schema parameter must be set to `"absProcedure"` to ensure that the request is processed correctly and targets the appropriate data structure. Failure to provide the correct schema may result in an error or unexpected behavior in the response.
