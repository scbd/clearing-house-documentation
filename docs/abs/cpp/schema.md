> When making an API request using the Community Protocols and Procedures and Customary Laws (CPP) schema, it is crucial to include the correct schema identifier. The schema parameter must be set to `"communityProtocol"` to ensure that the request is processed correctly and targets the appropriate data structure. Failure to provide the correct schema may result in an error or unexpected behavior in the response.
