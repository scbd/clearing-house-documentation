# Realms

## Overview
The **Realm** defines the specific context or environment in which a request is being made. It allows the system to appropriately route requests based on the specified environment. Realms are categorized into **Production** and **Development**, supporting both the **Clearing-House Mechanisms** and the **Online Reporting Tool (ORT)**.
