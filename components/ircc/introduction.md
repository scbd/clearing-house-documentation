## Introduction

Permits or their equivalent constituting an internationally recognized certificate of compliance (IRCC) are critical for ensuring that genetic resources are accessed in accordance with prior informed consent (PIC) and that mutually agreed terms (MAT) have been established. The IRCC serves as evidence that these conditions have been met and plays a key role in monitoring and enhancing transparency about the utilization of genetic resources.

To access this API, users must be affiliated with a government entity and possess one of the following roles: National Focal Point (NFP), National Authorized User (NAU), or Government Representative. These roles ensure that the individuals have the authority and responsibility to manage genetic resources and compliance certificates.

Moreover, the API and associated token are restricted to use within the context of a single government. Users cannot use the token for multiple governments or share it for cross-government operations. This restriction ensures that the process remains secure and that each government's compliance is managed independently.

### Key Provisions

1. **Issuance of Permit or Equivalent**: At the time of access, a permit or its equivalent is issued as evidence of the decision to grant PIC and the establishment of MAT.
2. **Publication to ABS Clearing-House**: This information is made available to the ABS Clearing-House in accordance with relevant articles of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).
3. **Constitution of IRCC**: Once the information is published in the ABS Clearing-House, an internationally recognized certificate of compliance is constituted.
4. **Role of IRCC**: The IRCC serves as evidence that the genetic resource covered has been accessed in accordance with PIC and MAT. It includes essential information such as issuing authority, date of issuance, provider, unique identifier, subject-matter or genetic resources covered, and confirmation of MAT and PIC.

Parties are required to fill out the form with mandatory fields to ensure the IRCC is constituted. Confidential information should not be submitted as all information made available to the ABS Clearing-House will be public.
