The following query parameters can be used to refine the request:

| Field         | Type   | Description                            |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| collection    | String | Optional. Specifies the collection or category of resources to query. This option allows clients to target specific sets of resources. The allowed values are `my` for a personal collection and `mydrafts` for draft items or documents. This helps in narrowing down the search to particular subsets of resources based on their classification or status. |
| $filter       | String | Optional. The `$filter` system query option allows clients to apply conditions to filter the results of a query. By using `$filter`, clients can retrieve only those resources that meet specific criteria, such as matching certain values or falling within a certain range. For detailed usage and examples, see the [OData $filter documentation](https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-v4/uri-conventions/#filter-system-query-option). |
| $orderby      | String | Optional. The `$orderby` system query option allows clients to specify the order in which resources should be returned. This enables sorting of results based on one or more properties, such as sorting by date, name, or other attributes. The specified sorting order helps in organizing the results in a meaningful way. For detailed usage and examples, see the [OData $orderby documentation](https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-v4/uri-conventions/#orderby-system-query-option). |
| $top          | String | Optional. The `$top` system query option limits the number of items returned in the query result. This is useful for controlling the size of the result set, particularly for pagination or for retrieving a specific subset of items. For example, setting `$top=10` would return only the top 10 items from the query result. For detailed usage and examples, see the [OData $top documentation](https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-v4/uri-conventions/#top-system-query-option). |
| $skip         | String | Optional. The `$skip` system query option specifies the number of items to be skipped from the beginning of the result set. This is often used in combination with `$top` to implement pagination, where `$skip` determines how many items to ignore before starting to include results. For example, setting `$skip=20` would skip the first 20 items and start returning results from the 21st item onward. For detailed usage and examples, see the [OData $skip documentation](https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-v4/uri-conventions/#skip-system-query-option). |
