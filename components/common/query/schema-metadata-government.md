| schema     | String   | Defines the format or schema of the document being posted. This field specifies the type and structure of the document to ensure it conforms to a predefined format or standard. It helps the system interpret and validate the incoming data correctly. The value for `schema` typically corresponds to a specific schema definition that outlines the required fields, data types, and constraints for the document. This ensures that the document adheres to the expected structure and is compatible with the system's processing rules. |
| metadata   | Object   | Optional. Contains additional information about the document that can be used to determine security access and other attributes. The `metadata` object can include various parameters depending on the document type and its requirements. This may encompass information such as access permissions, document classification, or other contextual data that helps manage the document effectively. The structure and content of `metadata` may vary based on the specific needs and configuration of the document type. |
| government | String   | Optional. Specifies the government code associated with the record for national records. The value should adhere to the "ISO 3166-1 alpha-2" standard, which uses two-letter country codes to represent different countries. This field is used to assign or categorize the record under a specific national jurisdiction or government entity. For records that are not tied to a national context, this field may be omitted or left blank. |
