| Content-Type   | String | Indicates the format of the data being sent in the request body. This header specifies the media type and encoding of the request payload. The allowed value is `application/json`, meaning that the request body is formatted as JSON. This helps the server understand how to parse and interpret the incoming data. |

Allowed values include `abs` (Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House), `chm` (Central Clearing-House Mechanism), and `bch` (Biosafety Clearing-House). Each value represents a different area of functionality or service. |
| Accept         | String | Specifies the format in which the client prefers to receive the response data. This header informs the server of the desired response format to ensure compatibility with the clientâ€™s data processing.

This ensures the response data is structured in a way that the client can properly handle and interpret. |
